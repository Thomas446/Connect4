# Connect4
Connect 4 with minimax AI using alpha beta pruning

To play, you must click one of the button options (e.g. play vs. AI or play vs. human). The board is disabled until you choose an option.

Since connect 4 is a pretty complex game, alpha beta pruning is used to reduce the time complexity.
